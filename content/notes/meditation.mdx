Your breath, the essence of life, often goes unnoticed. Your heart, the rhythm of existence, is ignored.
the world around you, its sounds and energies, is overlooked, creating an illusion of choice.
Life's true meaning is lost in the background.

**What kind of _art_ can you make with such a limited perspective?**

Many only awaken to life's depth in tragedy or loss. Take your _destiny_ into your own hands.

\- FTHR BRQS, TMS
