##### Overview

Asquire is a web platform for crowd-sourcing audio data consisting of various speech and non-speech sounds.
The Asquire project was developed with the motivation to provide an <u>**easy, effective, and fast diagnosis method**</u> for asthma using vocal
sounds and ML algorithms.

For collecting large quantity of good quality data, VAD was implemented within the app to verify if the recorded data is valid and give feedback to used to make sure they are following the instructions properly.

#### Algorithms

Signal-proessing techniques were used to process the recorded data and check if it is valid. 
A scoring system was used in the pipeline as feedback to users, and instructing them to record for longer, in a quiter environment, and louder.
