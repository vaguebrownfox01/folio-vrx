### Asquire Tako

Asquire-tako is a web application designed as an extension to the Asquire data collection application. It allows for simultaneous recording of voice data from multiple devices, with one device acting as the head device and controlling the other devices. The recorded audio is then uploaded to the cloud using Firebase as the backend.

The main goal of Asquire-tako is to enable researchers and healthcare professionals to gather voice data related to sustained phonations, breath sounds, and cough sounds from asthmatic patients from multilple everyday use devices like smartphones. The recorded audio can then be analyzed using data-driven and signal processing methods, as well as machine learning techniques, to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma.
