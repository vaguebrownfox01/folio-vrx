#### Overview

Pnoistor is a web application designed to aid data collection for the <a href="/posts/projects/pnoi-phone/pnoi-phone">Pnoi-phone</a> project.
It serves as a centralized platform for organizing, managing, and validating the dataset of respiratory sounds recorded simultaneously from the mouth and chest,
along with associated metadata.

The app adhers to the **data collection protocol** and **annotation scheme** defined for the Pnoi-phone project, ensuring the systematic collection of data.

#### Purpose

Pnoistor is an essential component of the Phoi-phone project, facilitating the systematic collection and management of respiratory sound data and associated metadata.
It is built to ensure a streamlined data collection pipeline for the development of an AI model aimed at predicting pulmonary function test (PFT) values using
respiratory sounds recorded simultaneously from the mouth and chest.

#### Features

Pnoistor offers the following key features:

-   **Centralized Data Organization**: Pnoistor provides a centralized platform to organize and manage the dataset of respiratory sounds recorded simultaneously from the mouth and chest. The data is uploaded and organised in cloud storage.

-   **Metadata Recording**: The application allows the recording of subjects' metadata associated with the respiratory sound data. This metadata helps in further analysis and contextualizing the collected data.

-   **Data File Renaming**: Pnoistor assists in automatically renaming data files to ensure consistency and ease of identification. The file nomeclature is defined in the Pnoi annotation scheme.

-   **Data Validation**: Pnoistor aids in identifying missing data files, ensuring the completeness of the dataset and preventing data loss. Further tests are done using pnoi-anotest

-   **Authentication and Authorization**: Only authorized project team members can access the Pnoistor web application, providing a secure environment for data collection.

-   **Device Compatibility**: Pnoistor is designed to be accessed and used on any device, ensuring flexibility and ease of use.

#### Technologies

React, Firebase, Material-UI, Node.js

#### Pnoi Annotation Scheme

Designed to ensure systematic collection of data, the Pnoi annotation scheme defines the nomenclature for data files, the data collection protocol, and the annotation protocol.
The scheme is designed to ensure consistency and ease of identification of data files, and to provide a standardized approach to data collection and annotation.

#### Pnoi Data Collection Protocol

The Pnoi data collection protocol defines the rationale for the data collection process, including the breathing protocol and well defined steps to follow.
The protocol is designed with help of pulmonologist to ensure the systematic collection of data and to provide a safe standardized approach.

#### Pnoi Recording table

A recording table with adjustible height, designed to hold the data collection device and the subject in a comfortable position.
It is to ensure recorded data is consistent and reliable across all subjects.
