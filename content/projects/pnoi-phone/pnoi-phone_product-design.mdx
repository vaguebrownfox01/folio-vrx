#### Overview

Pnoi-phone is an **acoustic-based** biomedical device/ system utilizing multimodal breath sounds to monitor and diagnose respiratory diseases.
The device is designed to be a <u>portable, non-invasive, and user-friendly</u> tool for healthcare professionals, caretakers and patients.
Refer <a href="/posts/projects/pnoi-phone/pnoi-phone">Pnoi-phone</a> page for background and more details.

##### Aim:
-   To design an innovative acoustic-based biomedical device for respiratory disease diagnosis and monitoring through multimodal breath sound analysis.

##### Objectives:
-   Conceptualize an easy-to-use, portable device design for capturing breath sounds from multiple chest locations.
-   Design the device hardware including components for acoustic capture, signal processing, and data visualization.
-   Develop user interface and experience design for healthcare professionals to monitor and interpret data.

### Design Process

The design process for the pnoi-phone is an iterative process that involves multiple stages of design, prototyping, and testing. 
The process is divided into 5 stages, each with its own set of problems and solutions.

todo:

-   5 versions of incremental design process with problems faces and respective solutions
-   brainstorming sketches and design process
-   3D models of design
-   3D printed prototypes of designs: images
-   3D interface section to view the final design
