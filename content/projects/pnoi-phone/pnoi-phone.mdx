#### Abstract

The Pnoi-phone is a biomedical system that employs **acoustic-based** methods
for diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary diseases using **breath sounds**. Given
the global health challenges of asthma and COPD, timely and accurate diagnosis
is crucial for enhancing patient outcomes.

#### Aim:

1. <u>Improve Asthma and COPD diagnosis</u>: Combine breath sounds and
   PFT data for more accurate and early detection.
2. <u>Develop Pnoi-phone </u>, a specialised biomedical device that
   simultaneously acquires breath sounds from various locations and
   uses AI models to diagnose and monitor airway diseases.

#### Objectives:

1. Create a <u>multimodal breath sounds corpus</u> of patients and controls
   (recorded with a high-end microphone and digital stethoscope) and
   corresponding PFT values.
2. Identify and characterise the vital features within breath sounds and PFT and
   build AI models to <u>predict PFT values</u> accurately using breath sounds.
3. <u>Design and develop a Pnoi-phone</u> biomedical device integrated
   with AI models to diagnose and monitor airway diseases.

#### Significance

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases among children worldwide.
It affected an estimated **262 million people** in 2019 and caused **4,61,000 deaths** [1].
Meanwhile, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (**COPD**) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing **3.23 million deaths** in the same year [1].
Treatment and effective management of asthma and COPD can save lives. The **underdiagnosis of respiratory diseases** is a significant societal challenge that affects people globally.
Many people with these diseases are not diagnosed on time, and this can lead to chronic health problems, <u>reduced quality of life, and even premature death</u>.

#### Current methods and challenges

<p style={{ 'text-align': 'center', margin: 'auto' }} width="320">
	{'Fig: Spirometry process'}
</p>
Respiratory diseases are diagnosed using medical history, physical
examination, and breathing tests like **spirometry; a gold standard
test**[2]. Spirometry measures lung function to check signs of airway
obstruction and other respiratory issues. However, there are
challenges associated with the test, such as requiring patient
cooperation, coordination, and effort to obtain reliable results. The
test's repeatability is limited, and equipment malfunctions and
calibration can induce variability, affecting the accuracy of the
result. The **complexity, high cost, and limited availability** of
spirometric testing hinder a significant portion of the population
from obtaining an accurate diagnosis and treatment for respiratory
diseases [2].

#### Solution

Our innovation aspires to address the issue by introducing an innovative **acoustic-based method** to evaluate pulmonary function test values (PFT) 
that can be effectively used for the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma. 
This method involves a device called **Pnoi-phone** that can capture and analyse multimodal breath sounds with **AI powered systems** to **identify abnormal patterns** indicative of respiratory diseases. 
It also offers **real-time, non-invasive monitoring** capabilities that enable healthcare professionals and patients to detect abnormalities early, 
track disease progression continuously, and assess treatment effectiveness.
With the help of Pnoi-phone, healthcare professionals, especially in **remote clinics**, can accurately and effortlessly diagnose respiratory diseases, allowing for early intervention and treatment.

#### Proof of Concept

	src="/images/projects/pnoi/pnoi_breath-sound-table.png"
	alt="pnoi-spirometry"
	width="100%"
	height="600"

<p style={{ 'text-align': 'center', margin: 'auto' }} width="320">
	{'Fig: Relationship between diseases and breath sounds'}
</p>
In Table 1 above, the first column shows the location of the sound from the upper airway to the lower airway with the corresponding sound type in relation to the associated disease [6][7]. 
The sounds from these airways can provide information that encodes the **sound signature of the disease**.
**Auscultation** is an essential physical examination. It is non-invasive, easy, and cost-effective. 
It requires minimal cooperation from the patient and can be repeated many times without any side effects, making it an optimal technique for prognosis [3]. 

However, it requires years of experience and specialisation to interpret the **auditory information** of lung breath sounds. 
The current technology of **digital stethoscopes** allows physicians to record the auscultation, enhance the sounds, and store the recording for future reference along with other useful features [4]. 
With these advantages on hand, it opens up a research path for exploring ways to *automate diagnosing and monitoring respiratory disease* using the sound of breath to provide better and **scalable methods** [5]. 
There are several studies based on the classification of auscultation sounds.

</p>

Successful scaling up and introducing the Pnoi-phone into healthcare would require several key considerations. 
Firstly, the device must be **affordable, portable, and easy to use**, especially in rural areas with limited resources. 
The cost of the device and the test will be significantly low. 
Additionally, the training of healthcare workers to use the device effectively and interpret the results correctly must be relatively more straightforward than that of their existing counterparts. 
An infrastructure to support the usage of this device for developing systems for **collecting, storing, and analysing data**. 
Enable research to ensure that the device is used correctly and that patients receive optimal care.

In summary, the Pnoi-phone represents a transformative advancement in
respiratory healthcare, promising improved patient outcomes and cost-effective
disease management through its unique approach, real-time monitoring
capabilities, and innovative AI technology. 

The project is funded by Department
of Science and Technology Govt. of India, and it is developed under SPIRE Lab,
IISc Bangalore in collaboration with St. John's Hospital, Bangalore.

#### Glossary
- **Pulmonary function test values (PFT)**: these refer to the results obtained from tests like spirometry (includes lung capacity, how well air flows in and out of the lungs, etc.), which can be used to diagnose lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- **Auscultation**: the medical practice of listening to sounds made by the internal organs of the body, typically using a stethoscope.
- **Metadata**: The pnoi-phone dataset consists of metadata that includes biodata, medical history, and response to the Performa given by the pulmonologist.
