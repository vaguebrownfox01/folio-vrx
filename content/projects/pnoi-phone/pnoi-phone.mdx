#### Abstract
The Pnoi-phone is a biomedical system that employs **acoustic-based** methods
for diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary diseases using **breath sounds**. Given
the global health challenges of asthma and COPD, timely and accurate diagnosis
is crucial for enhancing patient outcomes.

#### Aim:

1. <u>Improve Asthma and COPD diagnosis</u>: Combine breath sounds and PFT data
   for more accurate and early detection.
2. <u>Develop Pnoi-phone </u>, a specialised biomedical device that
   simultaneously acquires breath sounds from various locations and uses AI
   models to diagnose and monitor airway diseases.

#### Objectives:

1. Create a <u>multimodal breath sounds corpus</u> of patients and controls
   (recorded with a high-end microphone and digital stethoscope) and
   corresponding PFT values.
2. Identify and characterise the vital features within breath sounds and PFT and
   build AI models to <u>predict PFT values</u> accurately using breath sounds.
3. <u>Design and develop a Pnoi-phone</u> biomedical device integrated with AI
   models to diagnose and monitor airway diseases.

#### Project Overview

#### Current methods and challenges

Spirometry is a gold standard test for obstructive lung diseases. But it is
requires expensive equipment to conduct Pulmonary Test Function (PFT) for
diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Also, the spirometric test is complex
and sternuous for patients. The sounds of breath are adversly effected by
diseases like Asthma and COPD.

#### Motivation
The Pnoi-phone addresses these challenges by offering **real-time, non-invasive
monitoring** capabilities that enable healthcare professionals and patients to
detect abnormalities early, track disease progression continuously, and assess
treatment effectiveness. Its **portability and user-friendliness** enhance its
practicality in diverse clinical settings. This innovation arises from the
**simultaneous recording of breath sounds from two distinct sources** and
advanced data processing algorithms, differentiating it from conventional
methods.

In summary, the Pnoi-phone represents a transformative advancement in
respiratory healthcare, promising improved patient outcomes and cost-effective
disease management through its unique approach, real-time monitoring
capabilities, and innovative AI technology. The project is funded by Department
of Science and Technology Govt. of India, and it is developed under SPIRE Lab,
IISc Bangalore in collaboration with St. John's Hospital, Bangalore.
