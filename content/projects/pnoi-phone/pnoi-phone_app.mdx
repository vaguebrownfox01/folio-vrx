#### Overview
The smartphone app acts as an interface between the user and the Pnoi-phone hardware. 
The user, through the smartphone, can start/stop/pause the recording and collect and store the metadata of the patients.

#### System design
Pnoi-phone app is used to control various device functions such as **recording and storing the data**. 
The app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. It also provides a platform for the user to view the data and **metadata** collected by the device. 
It also integrates a trained **Pnoi AI model** to predict Pulmomnary Function Test **(PFT) values** and display them to the user.
