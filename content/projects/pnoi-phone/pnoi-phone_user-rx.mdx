#### Overview

Pnoi-phone is an innovative acoustic-based respiratory diagnostic tool aimed at providing an affordable, portable, and non-invasive way to evaluate lung function
and detect respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD.
As such, it has three primary intended users: healthcare providers such as pulmonologists who would perform testing and diagnose,
technicians who support testing, and patients getting tested.

</p>

To gather insights from these user groups, a user research was conducted in-context interviews and observations, seeking answers to questions like:

-   What challenges do you face in diagnosing respiratory illnesses today?
-   What would make spirometry/other testing easier and more effective?
-   Where do current solutions fall short?
-   How could a solution like Pnoi-phone fit into your diagnosis workflow?

About 9 to 10 months of interaction with people provided incredibly valuable perspectives.
For one, I gained **empathy for the difficulty** both providers and the trouble patients face today for accurate diagnosis using traditional spirometry.
At the same time, I better understood workflow and equipment needs from the technician point of view.
Testing also revealed opportunities to simplify the device and testing process itself.

#### To Do:

A detailed report is yet to be made about the core findings and insights from the research. This will provide rationale for the design decisions for the pnoi-phone system.
