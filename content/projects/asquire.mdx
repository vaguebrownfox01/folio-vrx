#### about

Asquire is a data collection application designed to collect voice data related
to <u>sustained phonations, breath sounds, and cough sounds</u>. The objective of this
project is to analyze the sound characteristics of the collected voice data
(recorded with smartphones) using data-driven and signal processing methods. The
ultimate goal is to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques for the diagnosis
and monitoring of asthmatic patients.

The current clinical methods for diagnosing asthma are often tedious, expensive,
and time-consuming. The Asquire project was developed with the motivation to
provide an <u>easy, effective, and fast diagnosis method</u> for asthma using vocal
sounds and ML algorithms. By utilizing the power of machine learning and signal
processing techniques, this project aims to overcome the limitations of
traditional diagnostic methods and provide a more efficient and accurate
solution.

#### how it works

Asquire collects voice data from users through a web application. The users are
instructed to perform sustained phonations, provide breath sounds, and cough
sounds. The application then processes this voice data using <u>data-driven and
signal processing methods</u>. Various sound characteristics such as frequency,
intensity, duration, and patterns are extracted from the voice samples.

The processed voice data is then used to train a machine learning model. The ML
model learns from the collected data to recognize patterns and associations
between sound characteristics and asthma conditions. Once the model is trained,
it can be used to analyze new voice samples and provide a diagnosis or
monitoring feedback for asthmatic patients.
