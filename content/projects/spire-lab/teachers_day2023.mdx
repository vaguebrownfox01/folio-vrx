For Teachers' Day on 5th September 2023,
I wanted to do something special for our professor who has been an inspiring mentor over the years.
Along with my labmates, I decided to create a gratitude webpage to showcase our messages to him.

#### Planning and Execution:

A few days before Teachers' Day, I reached out to all my labmates to contribute their messages and memories with professor.
Everyone had heartwarming stories and words of appreciation to share, a few requested to be anonymous.
I then built a simple webpage with all the messages mentorship, guidance, inspiration etc.

<img
	style={{
		margin: 'auto',
		padding: '8px',
		'border-radius': '16px',
	}}
	src="/images/projects/spire/teachers-day-webpage.png"
	alt="speech-pong-people"
	width="100%"
	height="600"
/>

On the evening of Teachers' Day, we gathered together and projected the webpage on a screen.
As professor read through the messages, shared some of his stories with all of us.
He then spent time reminiscing about his journey and imparting life lessons.
It was a memorable evening.
