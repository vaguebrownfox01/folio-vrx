### Overview

In SPIRE Lab, for IISc Open Day 2024, we developed an interactive game that challenges players to speak fast into a microphone to launch a ping pong ball out of a vertical tube! 
The goal was to apply speech processing techniques and simple embedded system to create a fun and engaging experience.

### System Design

The setup consisted of the following components:
  - **Microphone** - to record the player's speech
  - **Raspberry Pi** - for signal analysis and motor control
  - **Motor driver circuit** - to control the DC motor
  - **DC motor** - coupled to a fan to blow air into the tube
  - **Transparent tube** - houses the ping pong ball

The player's speech is recorded by the microphone and analyzed in real-time using pitch-based signal processing code to determine the speaking rate. 
As the measured speaking rate increases, the Rpi controls the motor driver using PWM signals to proportionally increase the speed of the DC motor.

In future, the game design and electronic hardware will be modularized to create a complete, easy to assemble product.
Overall, this fast-talking game project was an engaging and attracted 100+ participants, children and grownups alike! 
I enjoy using my technical abilities in a creative application at the intersection of software, hardware, and human interaction.
