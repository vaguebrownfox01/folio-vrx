### Overview

In SPIRE Lab, for IISc Open Day 2024, we developed an interactive game that challenges players to speak fast into a microphone to launch a ping pong ball out of a vertical tube! The winner gets a prize! others get a cookie for trying.. :D
The goal was to apply speech processing techniques and simple embedded system to create a fun and engaging experience.

### System Design

The setup consisted of the following components:
  - **Microphone** - to record the player's speech
  - **Raspberry Pi** - for signal analysis and motor control
  - **Motor driver circuit** - to control the DC motor
  - **DC motor** - coupled to a fan to blow air into the tube
  - **Transparent tube** - houses the ping pong ball

The player's speech is recorded by the microphone and analyzed in real-time using **pitch-based** signal processing code to determine the speaking rate.
The algorithm calcultes the density of **voiced and unvoiced** segments in the speech signal to estimate the speaking rate. 
Voiced segments are identified using **autocorrelation** to detect pitch in bandpass filtered speech signal.
As the measured speaking rate increases, the RPi controls the motor driver using **PWM** signals to proportionally increase the speed of the DC motor.

In future, the game design and electronic hardware will be modularized to create a complete, easy to assemble product with 3D printed components.
Overall, this fast-talking challenge game project was an engaging and attracted over 100+ participants, children and grownups alike! 


I enjoy using my technical abilities in a creative application at the intersection of software, hardware, and human interaction.
